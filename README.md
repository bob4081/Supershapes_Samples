# Supershapes Samples

## UE4 sample project that uses the Supershapes plugin
## REQUIRES SUPERSHAPES PLUGIN: (link coming soon)

Johan Gielis came up with the 'Superformula' which is an extension of the 'Superellipse' (x^2 +y^2 = r^2) to represent many complex shapes and curves that are found in nature. I've converted this formula to run in a material shader and provide examples on how to use it with this sample project.
